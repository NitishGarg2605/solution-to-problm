# Optimized Log Retrieval

Overview

This script efficiently retrieves logs from a large log file based on a specified date.

# Features

- Processes logs in 1MB chunks to handle large files efficiently.

- Uses heapq to maintain order.

- Avoids loading the entire file into memory.

- Works well for both sorted and unsorted logs.

# Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

- Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/log-retrieval-tool.git
cd log-retrieval-tool

- Usage->

Run the script with the log file path and date:

python log_retrieval.py /path/to/logfile.txt YYYY-MM-DD

Example:

python log_retrieval.py logs.txt 2024-12-01

# How It Works

Reads in chunks: Processes logs in small parts to avoid memory issues.

Filters logs by date: Extracts only the relevant lines.

Maintains order: Uses heapq.nsmallest() for ordering.
